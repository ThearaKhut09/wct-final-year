## 🔧 Making Them Consistent

If you want **one unified admin dashboard**, I can:

1. **Option A**: Enhance the main `admin.html` with better testing features
2. **Option B**: Create a more professional version of `demo.html`
3. **Option C**: Merge the best features of all three

## 🚨 Current Functional Differences

### Dashboard Data Display:

**admin.html**:
```javascript
// Shows data in professional cards
document.getElementById('total-customers').textContent = stats.data.overview.total_customers;
document.getElementById('total-products').textContent = stats.data.overview.total_products;
// + Recent orders table
```

**demo.html**:
```javascript
// Shows raw API response in collapsible details
showResult('dashboard-result', 'Dashboard Stats', result);
// Raw JSON display
```

### User Interface:

**admin.html**: Modern dashboard with sidebar, cards, modals
**demo.html**: Simple grid layout with buttons and results

### Error Handling:

**admin.html**: User-friendly notifications
**demo.html**: Technical error details

## 🛠 Recommendation

For your e-commerce business, I recommend:

1. **Primary**: Use `admin.html` for all daily admin operations
2. **Backup**: Keep `demo.html` for quick testing when something goes wrong
3. **Development**: Use `admin-test.html` only when debugging specific API issues

## 🎨 Would You Like Me To:

1. **Standardize the design** across all interfaces?
2. **Merge the best features** into one unified dashboard?
3. **Improve the main admin.html** with additional features?
4. **Fix any specific issues** you've noticed?

Please let me know which approach you prefer, and I can make the necessary adjustments to ensure consistency across your admin interfaces.
