# E-smooth Online - Issues and Fixes

## Dark Mode Issues (Fixed - July 1, 2025)

### Issues Found:
1. **Multiple Conflicting Theme Implementations** - Both layout and main.js had their own theme handlers
2. **Theme Loading Timing Issues** - Theme applied after DOM rendering causing flickering
3. **Missing Dark Mode Styles** - Some components lacked proper dark mode styling
4. **Event Listener Conflicts** - Multiple listeners on theme toggle button

### Fixes Applied:
1. **Centralized Theme Management** - Created `window.themeManager` for unified theme handling
2. **Pre-DOM Theme Loading** - Theme applied before DOM rendering to prevent flickering
3. **Enhanced CSS** - Comprehensive dark mode styles with proper !important declarations
4. **Improved Event Handling** - Single event listener with proper error handling

### Files Modified:
- `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php` - Theme manager implementation
- `public/js/main.js` - Conflict prevention and fallback handling
- `public/css/style.css` - Enhanced dark mode styles

### Status: âœ… RESOLVED
